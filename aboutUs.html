    <p id="teamInfo">"Team One" started as a random group of coding classmates that developed into the best team ever made. With one game under their belt anything and everything is possible in their near futures. Based out of Seattle,WA "Team One" has basically put Seattle on the map. They're currently looking at an acquisition of Apple. Keep up with their githubs for more exciting projects on the way! </p>
