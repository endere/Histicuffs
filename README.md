# Histicuffs

Description:  Histicuffs is a quiz fighting game that pits a character of your choice against a randomly selected historical figure.  You will be given 5 questions per round.  Two will be about your character, two will be about your opponent, and one will be a random historical question.  If you answer 3 questions right, you win the round.  Win three rounds, and you win the game!

Usage: To start the game, enter your name on the home page, then click on the portrait of the character you wish to play as.  You will automatically be taken to the game page once you click on a character.  Win or lose, you will likely want to play again.  When you arrive at the win or lose page, simply click the "Home" link to play again!
